# 📦 SCM NCR SQL Project

> A real-world **Supply Chain Management (SCM)** database project focused on **Non-Conformance Report (NCR)** tracking, Purchase Orders, RTV (Return to Vendor), and Warehouse Stock Management — built using **PostgreSQL 18**.

---

## 🧑‍💼 Project Overview

This project simulates a real manufacturing and supply chain workflow where:

- Defective materials are identified through **NCR (Non-Conformance Reports)**
- Suppliers are monitored through quality and replacement activities
- RTV (Return to Vendor) process is tracked
- Warehouse stock is monitored after replacement activities
- Purchase orders are linked to defective material handling

The project is inspired by real SCM operational activities such as:
- NCR tracking
- Supplier follow-up
- Purchase order monitoring
- Warehouse stock validation
- RTV processing
- SAP inventory movement handling

### 📦 Material Movement Types

| Movement Type | Description |
|---|---|
| **531** | NCR stock movement — defective material received |
| **541** | RTV movement — material returned to vendor |

## 🔄 Business Process Flow

```
1. Material received from supplier
         ↓
2. Quality team identifies defect → NCR raised
         ↓
3. NCR reviewed → Disposal decided (RTV / Scrap / Rework)
         ↓
4. Purchase Order created for replacement material
         ↓
5. Defective material dispatched to supplier (RTV)
         ↓
6. Supplier sends replacement → Warehouse stock updated
```
